# Web & Mobile Interface

Architecture, hooks, and patterns for reaching Maestro from a browser (desktop, tablet, or phone) over the local network.

---

## Overview

There is **one browser interface**: the **web-desktop bundle**. It is the same `src/renderer` React tree that Electron loads, recompiled for the browser. It talks to the Electron main process over a WebSocket bridge that mimics Electron IPC, so `window.maestro.*` calls work unchanged in the browser. Phones and tablets get the desktop UI with touch/mobile affordances layered on top (see [Touch, Keyboard & Voice](#touch-keyboard--voice-hooks)).

└── Browser client = the web-desktop bundle

```

The server stack is Fastify with plugins: `@fastify/cors`, `@fastify/websocket`, `@fastify/rate-limit`, `@fastify/static`. See `src/main/web-server/WebServer.ts`.

<!-- doc-refs-ignore -->

> There is no longer a separate mobile React app. The legacy `src/web/mobile/` bundle was retired in Phase 06; its portable hooks were hoisted into `src/renderer`. See the [historical appendix](#appendix-legacy-mobile-retirement-historical) at the end of this guide.

## The Web-Desktop Bundle

### Directory Structure

```text
src/web-desktop/
├── index.html          # HTML template + inline boot-error surface (__maestroShowBootError)
├── bootstrap.ts        # Entry point (see below)
├── electron-shim.ts    # Aliased for `electron`: contextBridge -> window.maestro,
│                       #   ipcRenderer.invoke -> bridge.invoke over WS
└── sentry-shim.ts      # Aliased for `@sentry/electron` and `@sentry/electron/renderer`
```

Built by `vite.config.web-desktop.mts` into `dist/web-desktop/`. Scripts: `npm run dev:web-desktop`, `npm run build:web-desktop`.

### Boot Sequence (`bootstrap.ts`)

`src/web-desktop/bootstrap.ts` is the browser entry point:

1. Polyfills the few Node/Electron globals the renderer probes at import time (`process.env`, `process.versions.electron`, `process.platform`, `global`).
2. Sets `document.documentElement.dataset.runtime = 'web-desktop'` before first paint, so CSS can gate phone-only rules with `html[data-runtime='web-desktop']`. The native Electron app never sets this, so those rules stay inert there.
3. Imports the real preload (`src/main/preload/index`), which calls `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` - under the shim that populates `window.maestro`.
4. Mounts the real renderer (`src/renderer/main`).
5. Registers the PWA service worker via `registerServiceWorker()` from `src/web/utils/serviceWorker.ts`.

On failure it renders through the shared `index.html` error surface (`__maestroShowBootError`), which includes a same-network hint.

### The IPC Bridge

The web-desktop build aliases `electron` to `src/web-desktop/electron-shim.ts` in the Vite config. The renderer's preload factories run unchanged under the alias:

- `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('maestro', ...)` writes to `window.maestro` in the browser.
- `ipcRenderer.invoke(channel, ...args)` becomes a `bridge.invoke` WebSocket frame to `/$TOKEN/ws`, resolved by the main process and returned over the same socket.
- Main -> renderer push events reach browser clients through `safeSend` (`src/main/utils/safe-send.ts`), which fans each event out to the desktop `webContents` AND to the bridge via `broadcastBridgeEvent`. (One deliberate exception is documented in [Deferred: web-server/callbacks/\*.ts](#deferred-web-servercallbacksts).)
- Every broadcast frame carries a `seq`, and `BroadcastService` keeps the most recent ones. The `connected` frame carries the counter at connect time (`bridgeSeq`), which is where a fresh client's `lastSeq` starts. When the socket drops (mobile browsers suspend it on every app switch and screen lock), the shim reconnects with `?since=<lastSeq>&epoch=<serverRun>`; the server replays the missed frames right after `connected` and the page carries on in place. Only when the gap cannot be replayed (the server restarted, or the gap outran the buffer) does the shim fall back to `window.location.reload()`.
- Local audio/video: `fs:readFile` returns a `maestro-media://` stream URL that only the Electron protocol handler can serve. `resolveMediaStreamSrc()` (`src/renderer/utils/mediaStreamSrc.ts`) maps it in web-desktop onto `/<token>/media/stream/<mediaToken>/<hex>`, which `MediaRoutes` (`src/main/web-server/routes/mediaRoutes.ts`) hands to the SAME range-aware handler, so a browser plays and scrubs the file instead of showing "Cannot Play This File". Same shape as `resolveConcertoHtmlSrc()` for Concerto iframes.
- Clipboard: never call `navigator.clipboard` directly from renderer code. It is undefined over plain HTTP (a plain LAN address), which is how web-desktop is usually reached, so the bare call throws before it copies. Route every copy through `safeClipboardWrite()` in `src/renderer/utils/clipboard.ts`, which owns the browser-vs-host decision and the insecure-context fallback.

This is why the renderer's own Zustand stores, IPC service wrappers, and components all work in the browser with no web-specific fork.

### Two Clients, One Sessions Store

The browser runs the same renderer as the desktop, which means every client
holds its **own** session tree and flushes it back into the one shared sessions
store. Nothing reconciled those trees, so an agent created in the browser never
appeared on the desktop, and one closed in the browser was resurrected the moment
the desktop's stale copy was written again (issues #1398 / #1492).

Two rules follow, and both are load-bearing:

- **Agent lifecycle is pushed, not polled.** `sessions:setMany` / `sessions:setAll`
  (`src/main/ipc/handlers/persistence.ts`) report what entered and left the store
  on the `sessions:lifecycleSync` channel, and every other client applies the
  delta through `useSessionLifecycleSync`
  (`src/renderer/hooks/session/useSessionLifecycleSync.ts`), strictly in arrival
  order - an add still restoring when the close for the same agent lands makes
  that close look like it names an agent this client never had. Main also
  tombstones a closed id so a peer flush already in flight cannot re-add it -
  the newest 1000, bounded by COUNT rather than age, because a suspended browser
  tab can be away for hours and no agent id is ever reused, so an old tombstone
  has nothing left to block but a stale write. A client away long enough to
  outlive its tombstone reloads on reconnect regardless: `BridgeClient` has no
  replay, so it re-reads the store rather than flushing what it still held.
  `setAll` merges its opening snapshot into the stored tree and only broadcasts
  additions: the client may not have heard about agents a peer created, so an
  absent id is preserved rather than treated as a close. Real closes arrive as
  explicit `removeIds` through `setMany`. Both handlers share one main-process
  write queue, so a final-agent backup cannot overlap a peer addition and later
  overwrite it. The delta is deliberately lifecycle-only - tab contents, read-state and
  queued messages are still last-writer-wins.
- **Which agent a client is looking at is per-client.** Write and read it through
  `src/renderer/utils/activeSessionPersistence.ts`, never
  `window.maestro.sessions.getActiveSessionId()` directly. A browser tab reloads
  on every refocus, and reading the shared pointer landed the user on whatever
  the DESKTOP had focused instead of the agent they were working in. The read is
  a ladder: `sessionStorage` (this TAB's own choice - two web-desktop tabs share
  an origin, so a localStorage-only answer would have each tab overwriting the
  other's), then `localStorage` (the last choice made in this browser, for a
  freshly opened tab), then the shared value (a first visit should land where the
  desktop is). Writing still reports to the shared store as well, which is what
  plugin `session.activated` events and the CLI's current-agent answer are built
  on. The same rule holds LIVE, not just on load: the web-desktop shim
  (`src/web-desktop/electron-shim.ts`) does not route the desktop's
  `active_session_changed` packet, and it drops the `activeTabChanged` flag off
  `tabs_changed`, which is an inventory snapshot and never a navigation request.
  With several operators connected, the desktop user switching agents used to
  yank every phone along with it.
- **One-shot turn side effects run in the desktop renderer only.** Every
  `safeSend` is fanned out to every browser, and a web-desktop client's
  `ownsSession` is permit-all, so with three phones on the LAN one finished turn
  wrote four History rows, four `query_events` rows and spawned four synopses.
  `useOwnedSideEffectGate()` (`src/renderer/hooks/agent/internal/useOwnedSessionGate.ts`)
  is false on web-desktop; the exit and error listeners still flip the tab idle
  there but skip the History entry, synopsis, stats row, git refresh, queue
  dequeue and spoken notification. A browser's own queued items still send,
  through `useQueueProcessing`'s idle drain, which is why the exit reducer holds
  the queue on a non-owning client instead of dequeuing without dispatching.

### Server-Injected Config

The main process injects configuration into `window.__MAESTRO_CONFIG__` inline in `index.html`, before any module runs:

```typescript
interface MaestroConfig {
	securityToken: string; // UUID - required in all API/WS/asset URLs
	sessionId: string | null; // Viewing a specific session, or null for the default view
	tabId: string | null; // Specific tab within a session
	apiBase: string; // e.g. "/$TOKEN/api"
	wsUrl: string; // e.g. "/$TOKEN/ws"
}
```

### URL Structure

```text
http://host:port/$SECURITY_TOKEN/                    # App root (web-desktop)
http://host:port/$SECURITY_TOKEN/desktop             # Same bundle, explicit path
http://host:port/$SECURITY_TOKEN/session/$SESSION_ID # Deep link into a session
```

The security token is a UUID that must be present in all API, WebSocket, and asset URLs. Static routing lives in `src/main/web-server/routes/staticRoutes.ts`; the token root, `/desktop`, `/session/:id`, and the valid-token catch-all all serve the web-desktop bundle's `index.html`.

### Web Login (Encore Feature `webLogin`)

An OPTIONAL second factor over the path token. With the flag off nothing below is consulted and the interface is reached exactly as before.

- **Factor 1 is the path token.** It makes the URL unguessable, and it is also the thing a user pastes into a group chat by accident.
- **Factor 2 is the session cookie.** `maestro_web_session`, issued by `POST /<token>/auth/login`, `Path=/<token>`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, and `Secure` only when `x-forwarded-proto: https` says a tunnel terminated TLS (the LAN server is plain HTTP, where a `Secure` cookie is silently dropped). Wire shapes: `src/shared/webLogin.ts`. Accounts and sessions: `src/main/web-server/auth/web-user-store.ts` (`web-users.json`, deliberately not a settings key - `settings:getAll` is reachable over the bridge).
- **`maestro-cli` is admitted by a secret, never by its address.** The CLI reads a per-boot `cliSecret` from `cli-server.json` and sends it as `CLI_SECRET_HEADER` on its WebSocket upgrade (`auth/cli-secret.ts`). Do NOT reintroduce a `127.0.0.1` exemption: the Cloudflare tunnel (`cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:<port>`) and any local reverse proxy deliver every REMOTE request over a loopback connection, so an address check would wave the whole internet through the moment Remote Control was on - the exact path a login exists to protect. A browser cannot set a header on an upgrade and a remote caller cannot read the file. `resolveWebRequestAuth()` / `isWebRequestAuthorized()` in `auth/web-login-policy.ts` are the only two questions any enforcement point asks.
- **Enforcement is one global `preHandler`** (`auth/web-login-hook.ts`, registered in `WebServer.setupMiddleware`), deny-by-default under `/<token>/` so a route added later is covered the moment it exists. The allow-list is the login flow, the PWA/static assets, the HTML index routes (which redirect to the form themselves, since a 401 JSON body has nothing to click) and `/<token>/ws` (which closes with `WEB_LOGIN_WS_CLOSE_CODE` = 4401 in `wsRoute.ts`). `/`, `/health`, `/og.png` and the Concerto routes are never touched.
- **`webLogin:*` is refused over the bridge** (`handlers/bridgeDenyList.ts`, matched by PREFIX). The desktop is the administrator: a browser that could call `webLogin:createUser` could mint itself an account from inside the session the gate constrains, and the same channels read the file holding every password hash.
- **Acting user.** Every `bridge.invoke` dispatch runs inside `runAsActingUser(client.user, ...)` (`auth/acting-user.ts`), an AsyncLocalStorage context, so main-side code asks `getActingUser()` instead of threading a user through hundreds of handler signatures. `undefined` means "the desktop" - `maestro-cli`, or any client while the gate is off.
- **The login page is rendered in MAIN** (`auth/login-page.ts`), not shipped in the bundle: the bundle is what the gate protects, so serving the app's JavaScript and then asking it to draw a form would hand the renderer to an unauthenticated browser and only then ask who it is. It paints with the user's active theme.
- **Revocation.** A cookie is checked at the upgrade and never again (re-resolving per frame would put a file read in front of every keystroke), so `WebServer` subscribes to `getWebUserStore().onChange(...)` and closes any live socket whose SESSION no longer resolves, with the same 4401. Keyed on the session (`WebClient.sessionId`), not the account: a password reset and a logout remove the session and keep the account, and both are exactly when a stolen socket has to die. The shim (`src/web-desktop/electron-shim.ts`) navigates to `/<token>/login` on that code instead of reconnecting.
- **What the page knows.** `staticRoutes.ts` injects `webLoginUser` and `webLoginRequired` into `window.__MAESTRO_CONFIG__` (typed in `src/shared/webClientConfig.ts`). They answer different questions: no user with the gate ON is `maestro-cli`, no user with it OFF is the feature simply unused. The login page's `next` is validated server-side by `safeNextPath()` (a path under THIS token, control characters stripped first, because the URL parser drops tabs and `/<TAB>/evil.example` is `//evil.example` to a browser).

## Touch, Keyboard & Voice Hooks

Because the browser runs the desktop renderer, all touch/mobile behavior lives **inside `src/renderer`**, gated at runtime so it stays inert on the native desktop app. There is no separate mobile hook tree.

### Touch primitives - `src/renderer/utils/touch.ts`

Canonical touch helpers. Do NOT re-derive `navigator.vibrate` calls or `matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)')` queries. Also documented in [SHARED-UTILS.md](SHARED-UTILS.md).

| Export               | Purpose                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isCoarsePointer()`  | True when the primary pointer is a finger/stylus. Gate touch-only UI on it.                     |
| `isTapGesture()`     | True when a touchstart/touchend pair is a tap (within `tapMoveTolerance`), not a scroll.        |
| `triggerHaptic()`    | Fire `navigator.vibrate` when supported; no-op otherwise. Defaults to a 10ms tap.               |
| `supportsHaptics()`  | Whether `navigator.vibrate` exists.                                                             |
| `HAPTIC_PATTERNS`    | Named vibrate patterns: `tap`, `send`, `interrupt`, `success`, `error`.                         |
| `GESTURE_THRESHOLDS` | Gesture tuning: `swipeDistance`, `swipeTime`, `pullToRefresh`, `longPress`, `tapMoveTolerance`. |
| `MIN_TOUCH_TARGET`   | `44` - minimum touch target (px) per Apple HIG.                                                 |

### Hoisted hooks - `src/renderer/hooks/utils/`

These were lifted out of the legacy mobile bundle and now serve the renderer everywhere:

| Hook                    | Purpose                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useKeyboardVisibility` | Tracks the virtual keyboard and publishes the `--keyboard-offset` CSS custom property so the active row rises above the soft keyboard. |
| `useLongPress`          | Scroll-aware long-press that opens right-click affordances (context menus, tab overlays). Built on `isTapGesture()`.                   |
| `useSwipeGestures`      | Directional swipe detection (drawer edge-swipe, session switching).                                                                    |
| `useVoiceInput`         | Voice-to-text via the Web Speech API for the AI input area.                                                                            |

### Terminal touch support

Added in Phase 06 for the xterm terminal:

- `src/renderer/components/TerminalTouchBar.tsx` - a compact key bar (Esc, Tab, sticky Ctrl, arrows, Enter) docked above the terminal on coarse-pointer devices. Buttons fire on `onPointerDown` with `preventDefault()` so terminal focus and the soft keyboard are never stolen.
- `src/renderer/utils/terminalKeys.ts` - shared `TERMINAL_KEY_SEQUENCES` and `toControlChar`, consumed by both the touch bar and `XTerminal.tsx` (sticky-Ctrl folds the next typed character into its control code). Key writes go through the SAME PTY path as keyboard input (`window.maestro.process.write`).
- `XTerminal.tsx` calls `term.focus()` on a genuine tap (`isTapGesture`) so mobile browsers reliably raise the soft keyboard.

---

## Phone Layout

Phones get the desktop renderer with a **phone layout**: fewer controls, icon-only toolbars, full-screen drawers, and sheets instead of anchored popovers. One predicate decides when that applies, and everything below keys off it.

### The predicate - `usePhoneLayout()` / `isPhoneLayout()`

`src/renderer/hooks/ui/useViewportBreakpoint.ts`. True for the web-desktop bundle at the `xs` breakpoint (below 640px, a phone held upright). Its CSS twin is `html[data-runtime='web-desktop'][data-bp='xs']` (the "Phone layout" section of `src/renderer/index.css`), so a surface simplified in JS and one simplified in CSS agree about when a phone is a phone.

It is viewport-driven on purpose, not pointer-driven: space is the constraint, and a desktop browser squeezed to phone width gets the same layout, which is also what makes it testable without touch emulation. Touch GESTURES (long-press, swipe) gate on `isCoarsePointer()` separately, because a tablet has a finger without being short on room. The native Electron app never reports phone layout, however narrow its window.

### What changes on a phone

### Rules for a new surface

- Gate a simplification on `usePhoneLayout()` (or the CSS twin), never on `isCoarsePointer()` alone.
- A touch gesture gates on `isCoarsePointer()`; use `LongPressable` for long-press and `useSwipeGestures` for swipes rather than hand-rolling timers.
- A tab chip's menu renders through `TabOverlayPortal`; do not `createPortal` a `fixed z-[100]` shell by hand. Any OTHER surface that needs a bottom sheet uses `<PhoneBottomSheet>` directly - it is the shell `TabOverlayPortal` itself draws, so the scrim, the grip swipe, the close button and the safe-area padding are written once.
- A three-state setting that tap-cycles beside a mouse becomes a LIST on a phone. Cycling one step per tap hides the options, offers no way back, and makes the user tap through a state they did not want (see `ComposerOptionsSheet`, which lists Access, Thinking, Effort, and Model instead of stepping them). Write the "set this mode" field patch beside the existing cycle patch in `tabHelpers/focusFields.ts` and have the cycle delegate to it, rather than adding a second copy of the invariant.
- A control that hides its label on a phone keeps its `title` (or `aria-label`), so it keeps an accessible name and a long-press tooltip.
- Any keyboard-only hint (a chord badge, a `<kbd>` keycap in a search box, an `↑↓ navigate` legend) carries `data-shortcut-hint`; the phone stylesheet hides them all. Do not gate one in JSX.
- A modal that should fill a phone needs nothing: passing a `resizeKey` (or stamping `data-modal-resize-key`) is what the phone stylesheet keys on. A small dialog that should stay a dialog passes no key.
- A surface that pans on drag (a canvas, a graph) opts out of the swipe-to-dismiss safety net with `data-no-swipe-dismiss` on its root.
- Never host a gesture in an invisible `position: fixed` strip. The drawer-opening edge swipes used to live in two such strips, and the left one sat above the tab bar and swallowed every tap on the magnifier and the first chip. Gate the gesture on WHERE the touch starts instead (`useEdgeSwipeHandlers`, spread on the app shell).
- A sheet that covers the element that opened it must ignore the synthesized mouse and click events that trail a long-press release (`PHONE_SHEET_SCRIM_ARM_MS`, the `scrimArmMs` default on `<PhoneBottomSheet>`), or it closes the instant the finger lifts. A sheet opened by a plain TAP has no such trailer and passes `scrimArmMs={0}`, so its first dismissal is not swallowed.

### Standalone mode (iOS home screen)

Opened as a page in Safari, the web view sits below the browser chrome and
`env(safe-area-inset-top)` is 0. Added to the Home Screen with the
`black-translucent` status bar the entry HTML declares, the same page runs under
the status bar and has to clear it itself. Measured on an iPhone 16 Pro (iOS 26.5
simulator, 402x874pt):

| Value                                                             | Safari tab | Home-screen web app |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| `innerHeight`, `100dvh`                                           | 714        | 874                 |
| `100svh`, `documentElement.clientHeight`, `html { height: 100% }` | 714        | **812**             |
| `env(safe-area-inset-top)` / `-bottom`                            | 0 / 0      | 62 / 34             |

Two rules in the "Home-screen web apps on iOS" block of `src/renderer/index.css`
follow from that table, and both are inert everywhere else because every other
runtime reports 0 for the insets and the same value for `100%` and `100dvh`:

- **The roots are `100dvh`, not `100%`.** `100%` is the small viewport, so the
  874pt shell inside an 812pt `#root` with `overflow: hidden` was clipped at the
  status-bar line, and the band under the composer showed the boot background
  from the entry HTML (`#0a0a0a`). That band is what a tester reported as the
  app "not reaching the bottom".
- **The shell, the floating drawers and the phone modal overlay pad by
  `--maestro-top-inset`.** iOS 26 draws a frosted status bar layer over any
  content under the bar and swallows taps in that band, so a header laid out at
  `y = 0` is dimmed, blurred and dead. The hamburger lived there, which is why
  the left-edge swipe was the only way to the menu.

### A dead button on the phone is usually the bridge, not the button

Every `window.maestro.*` call in the browser is a `bridge.invoke` frame over one
WebSocket (`src/web-desktop/electron-shim.ts`). Two properties of that path make
a working control look broken, and both are fixed in the bridge rather than per
caller:

- **A suspended socket does not reliably fire `close`.** iOS freezes the
  connection on app switch and screen lock, and the tab can come back with
  `readyState === OPEN` on a socket whose peer is gone. An invoke then parks in
  `pending` forever - no resolve, no reject, no error. `BridgeClient` now probes
  with the server's existing `ping` every 15s and closes the socket if no frame
  arrives within 8s, because `close` is the one path that already rejects every
  pending invoke and schedules a resuming reconnect. Any inbound frame counts as
  proof of life, not just a `pong`.
- **`ipcRenderer.send` and `ipcRenderer.invoke` are different directions.**
  `invoke` pairs with `ipcMain.handle`; `send` is fire-and-forget and pairs with
  `ipcMain.on`, which appears nowhere in the `_invokeHandlers` map. The shim has
  only one frame type, so it routes both through `bridge.invoke` - and every
  send-style API used to be a silent no-op in a browser, because the server
  answered "No ipcMain handler registered" and the shim's `send` wrapper, which
  cannot throw at its caller, logged it and swallowed it. `handleBridgeInvoke`
  now falls back to `ipcMain.emit` when a channel has `on` listeners. This was
  per-DIRECTION, not per-channel: any `send` API added later was born broken.

When a control genuinely does nothing on the phone but works on the desktop,
check for a third shape before hunting the component: a handler that `await`s an
IPC call **before** it renders anything. `probeSessionAiProcesses` did, so a slow
or hung round trip meant Enter produced no bubble, no queued card, and no error.
Draw the optimistic state first, or bound the call.

---

### The keyboard is not a viewport change

On iOS the on-screen keyboard slides **over** the layout viewport rather than
shrinking it, so `100dvh` is unchanged while the bottom ~45% of the screen is
covered. A full-screen phone modal sized to `100dvh` therefore keeps its full
height with its lower half behind the keys.

That is invisible until a surface autofocuses a text field on open, which both
search surfaces did: the command palette (`useFocusAfterRender` on its input) and
the tab switcher (`useFocusOnMount`). The keyboard was up from the first frame,
so the results list was born buried - the user could type to filter, but the rows
they were trying to scroll through were behind the keyboard. It reads as "I can
search but I can't scroll the list."

Two rules follow, and a phone surface with a list and a filter box needs both:

- **Size a full-screen phone modal to `var(--maestro-viewport-height, 100dvh)`,
  never bare `100dvh`.** That variable is `visualViewport.height`, the half that
  the keyboard does shrink, republished on every `visualViewport` resize by
  `installStandaloneStatusBarInset()`. The `100dvh` fallback covers a browser
  with no `visualViewport`, where the two are the same number anyway.
- **Do not autofocus the filter input on a phone.** Gate it on
  `usePhoneLayout()` - `useFocusAfterRender(ref, !phone)` or
  `useFocusOnMount(ref, undefined, !phone)`. The list is what the surface is for;
  a phone user taps the field when they want to type, and on the desktop the
  keyboard-first focus costs nothing and stays.

---

`--maestro-top-inset` is `max(env(safe-area-inset-top), var(--maestro-status-bar-inset))`.
The second operand exists because WebKit sometimes reports the inset as 0 and
shortens the viewport by the bar height instead
([WebKit bug 301994](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=301994), reopened
against iOS 26.5 and the iOS 27 beta). `installStandaloneStatusBarInset()` in
`src/renderer/utils/standaloneStatusBar.ts` publishes `screen.height - innerHeight`
for a portrait home-screen web app, and the web bootstrap calls it before the
renderer loads. The fade itself is Apple's layer, not a Maestro gradient: the only
top gradient in the stylesheet is the light `chrome-sheen`, which also renders in
a Safari tab where no fade appears.

**Verifying on a simulator.** `xcrun simctl` cannot add a page to the Home
Screen, and the share sheet is the one Safari surface neither the accessibility
bridge nor synthesized taps reach. A configuration profile with a
`com.apple.webClip.managed` payload (`FullScreen` true) served with the
`application/x-apple-aspen-config` MIME type installs through Safari's download
prompt and Settings, all of which the Simulator exposes to macOS accessibility, and
the resulting web clip runs with `navigator.standalone === true`. Have the probe
page beacon its numbers to the serving host; screenshots are not needed for them.

## PWA (Progressive Web App)

The install prompt, offline shell, and app icons come from a small set of static assets that are the only load-bearing part of `src/web/` at runtime.

### Assets - `src/web/public/`

```text
src/web/public/
├── manifest.json       # PWA manifest (name, icons, display, theme color)
├── sw.js               # Service worker (offline shell, static asset caching)
└── icons/              # icon-72x72 ... icon-512x512 (8 sizes)
```

The web-desktop Vite config sets `publicDir: src/web/public`, so a `build:web-desktop` copies these into `dist/web-desktop/` alongside the app. This is the ONLY surviving consumer of `src/web/public/`.

### Serving

- `WebServer.resolveWebAssetsPath()` probes the web-desktop bundle root for `manifest.json` and sets `webAssetsPath` to it (== the bundle root). If the bundle is unbuilt it logs a warning and the PWA routes return 404.
- `staticRoutes.ts` serves `/$TOKEN/manifest.json` and `/$TOKEN/sw.js` (cached) from `webAssetsPath`.
- `WebServer.ts` mounts `/$TOKEN/icons/` from `webAssetsPath/icons`.

### Registration - `src/web/utils/serviceWorker.ts`

`registerServiceWorker()` (called from `bootstrap.ts`) reads the security token from `window.__MAESTRO_CONFIG__` and registers `/$TOKEN/sw.js` at scope `/$TOKEN/`. It swallows its own failures (unsupported browser, registration error) so it never affects boot. Its only dependency inside `src/web/` is `src/web/utils/logger.ts`.

**Load-bearing subset of `src/web/`:** `public/`, `utils/serviceWorker.ts`, and its transitive dep `utils/logger.ts`. Everything else under `src/web/` (`components/`, most of `hooks/` and `utils/`, `constants/`) is orphaned dead code after the legacy mobile retirement; nothing outside `src/web/` imports it. It is a candidate for a future sweep.

---

## Deferred: web-server/callbacks/\*.ts

Main-to-renderer push events only reach browser clients when they go through `safeSend` (`src/main/utils/safe-send.ts`), which fans each event out to the desktop `webContents` AND to the web-desktop bridge via `broadcastBridgeEvent`. The Phase 01 migration routed the session/app data sends across the IPC handlers through `safeSend` so web clients stop silently missing group chat, stats, Cue, and Auto Run events.

`src/main/web-server/web-server-factory.ts` and the per-domain callback modules it wires up (`src/main/web-server/callbacks/*.ts`) were deliberately left out of that migration. Their ~60 direct `webContents.send(...)` calls are not new events originating in the main process: they mirror actions that a web client already performed (over the WebSocket bridge) back onto the desktop renderer so the two surfaces stay in sync. Bridging those sends through `safeSend` would echo each web-originated action straight back to the web client that initiated it, causing duplicate state updates and feedback loops.

Wiring the factory into the bridge therefore requires an echo-suppression design (for example, tagging each mirrored event with its originating client id and having the bridge skip re-delivering it to that origin) before the sends can safely fan out. That work is out of scope for the safeSend parity pass and is tracked as a separate effort. Until then, leave the `web-server-factory.ts` / `callbacks/*.ts` sends as direct `webContents.send(...)` calls.

## Appendix: Legacy Mobile Retirement (historical)

<!-- doc-refs-ignore:start -->

Before Phase 06, the browser interface was a **separate** mobile-optimized React app under `src/web/mobile/` (~39 components) with its own WebSocket/session hooks (`src/web/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`, `useSessions.ts`, ...) and its own Vite bundle (`vite.config.web.mts`, output `dist/web/`). By that point it was already dead: `staticRoutes.ts` served the web-desktop bundle for every SPA route, and the mobile bundle's `index.html` was never served. Its portable hooks had been hoisted into `src/renderer` (Phases 04-05).

Phase 06 retired it in three steps:

1. **Inventory (step 1):** cataloged every reference to the mobile app outside `src/web/`, with a keep/remove verdict (preserved below).
2. **Deletion (step 2):** `git rm -r src/web/mobile`; removed the four orphaned hoisted hooks from `src/web/hooks/`; removed the mobile entry points (`src/web/{App.tsx,main.tsx,index.html,index.ts}`); removed npm scripts `dev:web`/`build:web`, dropped `&& npm run build:web` from `build`, and deleted `vite.config.web.mts`; removed the legacy `dist/web/assets/` static mount. To keep the PWA alive, the asset source was repointed: the web-desktop Vite config gained `publicDir: src/web/public`, and `resolveWebAssetsPath()` now probes `manifest.json` in the web-desktop bundle instead of the retired `dist/web` directory.
3. **Documentation (step 3):** this rewrite.

### Cross-`src/web` keep dependency

`src/web-desktop/bootstrap.ts` imports `registerServiceWorker` from `src/web/utils/serviceWorker.ts`. This is the reason step 2 kept `serviceWorker.ts` (and its transitive dep `logger.ts`). The legacy importers of the same module went away with the mobile app.
