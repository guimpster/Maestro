## Agent Registration Pipeline

```text
1. Agent IDs         src/shared/agentIds.ts           Single source of truth for all agent IDs
2. Definitions       src/main/agents/definitions.ts   CLI args, config options, argument builders
3. Capabilities      src/main/agents/capabilities.ts  Feature flags per agent
4. Detection         src/main/agents/detector.ts      Runtime binary detection + PATH resolution
5. Output Parsers    src/main/parsers/                 JSON output normalization per agent
6. Error Patterns    src/shared/agentErrorPatterns.ts    Regex patterns for error detection
7. Session Storage   src/main/storage/                 Per-agent session file reading
8. Picker Registry   src/shared/agentMetadata.ts       Whether and how the user can choose it
```

Steps 1-7 make an agent work. Step 8 is what makes it reachable: an agent that
is defined, capable, and detected is still invisible in the UI until it has a
`AGENT_PICKER_META` entry.

---

## 1. Agent IDs (`src/shared/agentIds.ts`)

The canonical list of all agent IDs:

```typescript
export const AGENT_IDS = [
	'terminal',
	'claude-code',
	'codex',
	'gemini-cli',
	'qwen3-coder',
	'opencode',
	'factory-droid',
	'copilot-cli',
	'grok',
] as const;

export type AgentId = (typeof AGENT_IDS)[number];
```

**Adding a new agent:** Add the ID string to `AGENT_IDS`. TypeScript enforces updates everywhere via the `AgentId` type.

### Related Metadata (`src/shared/agentMetadata.ts`)

```typescript
AGENT_DISPLAY_NAMES: Record<AgentId, string>       // Human-readable names
BETA_AGENTS: ReadonlySet<AgentId>                  // Agents showing "(Beta)" badge
AGENT_PICKER_META: Record<AgentId, Meta | null>    // Picker presentation, null = never offered
PICKABLE_AGENT_IDS: readonly AgentId[]             // Picker order, sorted by display name
AGENT_AUTOSELECT_ORDER: readonly AgentId[]         // Which provider a picker defaults to
getAgentDisplayName(agentId): string               // Get name with fallback
isBetaAgent(agentId): boolean                      // Check beta status
getAgentPickerMeta(agentId): Meta | null           // Description + brand color, or null
getAgentLoginCommand(agentId, customPath?)         // Re-auth command, or null
formatAgentLoginCommand(login, syntax?)            // Render it as a shell line
loginShellSyntaxFor(shellId, isWindows)            // 'posix' | 'powershell' | 'cmd'
```

**Provider pickers** all read `AGENT_PICKER_META`. The New Agent modal's
`SUPPORTED_AGENTS` re-exports `PICKABLE_AGENT_IDS`; the New Agent Wizard's
`AGENT_TILES` is derived from the record (name from `getAgentDisplayName`, pitch
and brand color from the entry); the Group Chat moderator dropdown renders those
same tiles filtered by what detection found installed. `null` withholds an agent
from all three - correct for `terminal` (internal) and `gemini-cli` (kept for
type and back-compat only). Because the record is keyed by `AgentId`, a new id
does not compile until that decision is made. Do NOT add a fourth hand-written
list of agent ids for a new picker; the three used to be hand-written, and Grok
and Qwen3 Coder shipped selectable in one of them and missing from the other two.

`PICKABLE_AGENT_IDS` sorts the record by display name, so all three surfaces show
the same alphabetical list and the record's key order carries no meaning - add a
new entry wherever it reads best. A picker that has to choose for the user reads
`AGENT_AUTOSELECT_ORDER` and takes the first entry that is installed; do NOT
default to `PICKABLE_AGENT_IDS[0]`, which is only ever "whatever sorts first".

Registering a provider also means drawing it: a `case` in `AgentLogo`
(`src/renderer/components/Wizard/screens/AgentSelectionScreen/components/AgentLogo.tsx`)
and a glyph in `AGENT_ICONS` (`src/renderer/constants/agentIcons.ts`). Without
the logo case the tile renders a blank fallback ring, and a test in
`AgentSelectionScreen/components.test.tsx` fails.

**Re-authentication commands** are keyed by `AgentId`, so adding an agent forces a decision about how it logs in. An entry carries `binary` + `args` (the line Maestro types into the re-authentication terminal) and an optional `followUp` for providers whose login only exists as a slash command inside their TUI (`gemini-cli`, `qwen3-coder`, `factory-droid`). `null` means the agent has no login flow of its own. `getAgentLoginCommand` returns `null` for unknown ids rather than guessing, because the result is executed in a shell. The consumer is `ReauthModal` (`src/renderer/components/ReauthModal.tsx`); do not hand-roll a second login-command table.

**Five things about the login shell `ReauthModal` spawns are not optional, and every one of them was a bug first.**

1. **The command is typed on the shell's FIRST BYTE, not when the spawn resolves.** Over SSH the spawn resolves as soon as the local `ssh` client is running, seconds before the remote shell exists, and anything written into that gap is dropped - which is how a remote re-authentication came up as an empty box. The command is held in a ref until `process.onData` fires for that PTY, with an 8 second fallback for a shell that prints no prompt at all.
2. **Spawn and kill live in ONE effect.** Split across two, StrictMode's remount (cleanup, then re-run) killed the shell the first pass had just started while a `spawnStarted` boolean blocked the second pass from starting another, leaving a dead PTY nobody typed into. The guard is therefore a generation counter the cleanup resets, and every async continuation re-checks it, so a remount ends with exactly one live shell.
3. **Over SSH, no working directory is passed.** The shell exists only to run a login; it gains nothing from the project directory, and main turns `workingDirOverride` into a `cd` the remote runs first, so a stale or local-looking path kills the session before the login can start. Landing in the remote home directory is always safe. Never fall back to `session.cwd` on a remote.

4. **The command is submitted with CR, not LF.** That is what a real Enter key sends, and on Windows it is the only one that works: ConPTY passes LF through as Ctrl+J, which PSReadLine does not read as "run this line", so the login command sits on the prompt untyped forever. A Unix PTY maps CR to NL itself, so CR is correct everywhere.
5. **On Windows the login never runs in WSL, even when WSL is the default shell.** Agents are always spawned as native Windows processes - nothing in the spawn path goes through `wsl.exe` - so a login inside WSL writes credentials into the WSL home directory that the native agent never reads. The flow looks like it succeeded and fixes nothing. `ReauthModal` substitutes `powershell` for a `wsl` default; an SSH remote is exempt, since its shell belongs to the remote host. The same split decides quoting: `loginShellSyntaxFor()` maps the shell id to a dialect, and `formatAgentLoginCommand()` prefixes the call operator `&` for a quoted path in PowerShell, which otherwise parses a line starting with a quoted string as an expression and just echoes it. Agents install under `C:\Program Files\...`, so that is the common Windows case, not an edge case.
   A login shell that dies without printing anything also writes `[the login session ended]` into the terminal, because an empty box with no explanation is indistinguishable from a hang.

**The same dialog serves a login the user ASKED for, and `AuthOutage.initiatedBy` is the only thing that separates them.** `startManualReauth(sessionId)` (`src/renderer/stores/authOutageStore.ts`), behind the Command K entry **Re-authenticate Provider**, builds the same outage record `reportAuthFailure` does, on purpose: one login shell, one SSH resolution, one environment disclosure, one resume path, rather than two that drift. Only data differs - an `initiatedBy: 'user'` outage carries no provider error text and a roster with no lost tabs, so `ReauthModal` swaps its copy (nothing is stopped, no queue is held, the button says `Done` rather than `Resume Agent`). Claiming a recovery that did not happen is a lie the user has to go and disprove. Two rules keep the reuse honest. The flag **upgrades to `'failure'` and never back**, because credentials expiring while the user is signing in by hand really does block agents and the roster then has to be described truthfully (`reportAuthFailure` also backfills the `message`, which is the first real evidence of what broke). And `resolveAuthOutage` **skips `clearAgentError` for a healthy agent on a manual login**: that call forces the session to `'idle'`, which would report a turn still running in another tab as finished. An agent that IS in the error state still clears, manual login or not - its held queue has to be released either way.

**The sign-in URL needs a Copy button, because it cannot be read off the screen.** `findLoginUrl()` (`src/renderer/utils/loginUrl.ts`) scans a rolling tail of the login PTY's output and `ReauthModal` surfaces the match as `Copy Login URL`. Every part of that is load-bearing for the same reason: the URL is hundreds of characters of query string, the TUI soft-wraps it across several rows so it is not one selectable run of text, and a provider TUI with mouse tracking on eats the drag that would select it anyway - so without the button the user has no way to reach it and the login is abandoned. Three details in the scanner are decisions, not accidents. It strips ANSI first and REJOINS rows the terminal wrapped, since a newline inside a URL is formatting rather than content (a blank line is a real break and is kept, so following prose is never glued onto the link). It matches against an ALLOWLIST of sign-in hosts rather than taking any URL, because the same screen prints docs and status links and a Copy button that silently grabs the wrong one sends the user somewhere that cannot log them in. And it returns the LAST match, because a retried login prints a fresh URL and the earlier one is spent. Do not hand-roll a second URL scraper for a new provider - add its host to `LOGIN_URL_HINTS`.

**Testing that flow means faking the failure, not waiting for one.** The command
palette carries `Debug: Trigger Provider Re-auth` and a `(Cue pipeline)` variant,
which call `debug:simulateAuthExpiry` in the MAIN process. The handler emits the
real `agent:error` / `agent:authExpired` event rather than poking the renderer's
stores, so classification, the provider-scoped outage grouping, the modal, the
login PTY, and the resume that replays blocked turns all run exactly as they do
in production - anything that only works when a test reaches past the IPC
boundary is a bug this is meant to catch, not hide. Two payload details decide whether the
exercise proves anything: the interactive variant sends the FULL process id
(`{sessionId}-ai-{tabId}`), because that is what a real error carries and it is
how the failing tab is identified for replay, while the pipeline variant sends
the bare agent id on the separate channel Cue uses (its agents are spawned
outside the ProcessManager). Send a bare id down the interactive path and the
dialog opens and then resumes nothing, which looks like a passing test.

### Context Windows (`src/shared/agentConstants.ts`)

```typescript
DEFAULT_CONTEXT_WINDOWS: Partial<Record<AgentId, number>>;
// claude-code: 200000, codex: 200000, opencode: 128000, factory-droid: 200000, terminal: 0

FALLBACK_CONTEXT_WINDOW = 200000; // Default when no entry exists

COMBINED_CONTEXT_AGENTS: ReadonlySet<AgentId>; // Agents with combined I/O context (codex)
```

---

## 2. Agent Definitions (`src/main/agents/definitions.ts`)

Each agent definition includes CLI configuration:

```typescript
// AgentDefinition is derived from AgentConfig:
// export type AgentDefinition = Omit<AgentConfig, 'available' | 'path' | 'capabilities'>;
//
// AgentConfig (in definitions.ts) contains:
interface AgentConfig {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	binaryName: string; // Binary to look for (e.g., 'claude', 'codex')
	command: string; // Default command to execute
	args: string[]; // Base args always included (excludes batch mode prefix)
	available: boolean; // (runtime only - not on AgentDefinition)
	path?: string; // (runtime only - not on AgentDefinition)
	customPath?: string; // User-specified custom path
	requiresPty?: boolean; // Whether agent needs pseudo-terminal
	configOptions?: AgentConfigOption[]; // Agent-specific configuration
	hidden?: boolean; // Hide from UI (terminal is hidden)
	capabilities: AgentCapabilities; // (runtime only - not on AgentDefinition)

	// Argument builders (optional per agent)
	batchModePrefix?: string[]; // Args added before base args for batch mode (e.g., ['run'] for OpenCode)
	batchModeArgs?: string[]; // Args only applied in batch mode
	jsonOutputArgs?: string[]; // Args for JSON output format
	resumeArgs?: (sessionId: string) => string[]; // Build resume flags
	readOnlyArgs?: string[]; // Read-only mode flags
	modelArgs?: (modelId: string) => string[]; // Model selection flags
	yoloModeArgs?: string[]; // Full-access/bypass flags
	workingDirArgs?: (dir: string) => string[]; // Working directory flags
	imageArgs?: (imagePath: string) => string[]; // Image attachment flags
	promptArgs?: (prompt: string) => string[]; // Prompt flags (e.g., [-p, prompt] for OpenCode)
	noPromptSeparator?: boolean; // Don't add '--' before prompt
	defaultEnvVars?: Record<string, string>; // Default env vars
	readOnlyEnvOverrides?: Record<string, string>; // Env overrides in read-only mode
	readOnlyCliEnforced?: boolean; // Whether CLI enforces read-only (vs prompt-only)
}
```

### Configuration Options

Agent-specific UI settings using discriminated union types:

```typescript
// All options share BaseConfigOption { key, label, description }.
type AgentConfigOption =
	| {
			type: 'checkbox';
			key: string;
			label: string;
			description: string;
			default: boolean;
			argBuilder?: (value: boolean) => string[];
	  }
	| {
			type: 'text';
			key: string;
			label: string;
			description: string;
			default: string;
			argBuilder?: (value: string) => string[];
	  }
	| {
			type: 'number';
			key: string;
			label: string;
			description: string;
			default: number;
			argBuilder?: (value: number) => string[];
	  }
	| {
			type: 'select';
			key: string;
			label: string;
			description: string;
			default: string;
			options?: string[]; // Optional when dynamic is true
			dynamic?: boolean; // Fetched at runtime via discoverConfigOptions()
			argBuilder?: (value: string) => string[];
	  };
```

The `argBuilder` function converts the setting value to CLI arguments.

### Agent-Specific Examples

**Claude Code** args: `['--print', '--verbose', '--output-format', 'stream-json', '--dangerously-skip-permissions']`

- No `batchModePrefix` - `--print` is part of base `args`
- resumeArgs: `(id) => ['--resume', id]`
- readOnlyArgs: `['--permission-mode', 'plan']`
- modelArgs: `(id) => ['--model', id]`

**Codex** args: `[]` (interactive mode has no base args)

- batchModePrefix: `['exec']`
- batchModeArgs: `['--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox', '--skip-git-repo-check']`
- jsonOutputArgs: `['--json']`
- resumeArgs: `(id) => ['resume', id]`
- readOnlyArgs: `['--sandbox', 'read-only', '--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox', '--skip-git-repo-check']`
- modelArgs: `(id) => ['-m', id]`
- imageArgs: `(path) => ['-i', path]`
- workingDirArgs: `(dir) => ['-C', dir]`
- yoloModeArgs: `['--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox']`

**OpenCode** args: `[]`

- batchModePrefix: `['run']`
- jsonOutputArgs: `['--format', 'json']`
- resumeArgs: `(id) => ['--session', id]`
- readOnlyArgs: `['--agent', 'plan']`
- modelArgs: `(id) => ['--model', id]`
- imageArgs: `(path) => ['-f', path]`
- Note: No `promptArgs` - prompt is positional. `noPromptSeparator` is NOT set on OpenCode (it uses the default `--` separator; see comment in definitions.ts)

**Factory Droid** args: `[]`

- batchModePrefix: `['exec']`
- batchModeArgs: `['--skip-permissions-unsafe']`
- jsonOutputArgs: `['-o', 'stream-json']`
- resumeArgs: `(id) => ['-s', id]`
- readOnlyArgs: `[]` (exec is read-only by default)
- modelArgs: `(id) => ['-m', id]`
- imageArgs: `(path) => ['-f', path]`
- workingDirArgs: `(dir) => ['--cwd', dir]`
- yoloModeArgs: `['--skip-permissions-unsafe']`
- noPromptSeparator: `true`

### Access Functions

```typescript
getAgentCapabilities(agentId: string): AgentCapabilities
// Returns capabilities or DEFAULT_CAPABILITIES for unknown agents

hasCapability(agentId: string, capability: keyof AgentCapabilities): boolean
// Quick check for a single capability
```

---

## 4. Agent Detection (`src/main/agents/detector.ts`)

The `AgentDetector` class detects installed agents at runtime:

```typescript
class AgentDetector {
	setCustomPaths(paths: Record<string, string>): void; // User-configured paths
	async detectAgents(): Promise<AgentConfig[]>; // Detect all agents (cached)
	async discoverModels(agentId: string, forceRefresh?): Promise<string[]>; // Model discovery
}
```

Detection process:

1. Check custom paths first (user-configured in settings)
2. Probe platform-specific paths (Windows registry locations, Homebrew, npm global, etc.)
3. Fall back to PATH-based detection via `which`/`where`
4. Cache results (model cache TTL: 5 minutes)
5. Return `AgentConfig[]` with `available: boolean` and resolved `path`

### Path Probing (`src/main/agents/path-prober.ts`)

```typescript
checkCustomPath(customPath: string): Promise<BinaryDetectionResult>
probeWindowsPaths(binaryName: string): Promise<string | null>
probeUnixPaths(binaryName: string): Promise<string | null>
checkBinaryExists(binaryName: string): Promise<BinaryDetectionResult>
getExpandedEnv(): NodeJS.ProcessEnv  // PATH with common binary locations
getExpandedEnvWithShell(): Promise<NodeJS.ProcessEnv>
```

---

## 5. Output Parsers (`src/main/parsers/`)

Each agent has a parser that normalizes its output into `ParsedEvent` objects.

### Parser Interface (`src/main/parsers/agent-output-parser.ts`)

```typescript
interface AgentOutputParser {
	readonly agentId: ToolType;

	parseJsonLine(line: string): ParsedEvent | null;
	parseJsonObject(parsed: unknown): ParsedEvent | null;
	isResultMessage(event: ParsedEvent): boolean;
	extractSessionId(event: ParsedEvent): string | null;
	extractUsage(event: ParsedEvent): ParsedEvent['usage'] | null;
	extractSlashCommands(event: ParsedEvent): string[] | null;
	detectErrorFromLine(line: string): AgentError | null;
	detectErrorFromParsed(parsed: unknown): AgentError | null;
	detectErrorFromExit(exitCode: number, stderr: string, stdout: string): AgentError | null;
}
```

### ParsedEvent (Normalized Output)

```typescript
interface ParsedEvent {
	type: 'init' | 'text' | 'tool_use' | 'result' | 'error' | 'usage' | 'system';
	sessionId?: string;
	text?: string;
	toolName?: string;
	toolCallId?: string; // Stable id used to merge running -> completed for the same call
	parentToolUseId?: string; // Set on activity spawned by a parent tool (e.g. Task subagents)
	toolState?: unknown;
	usage?: {
		inputTokens: number;
		outputTokens: number;
		cacheReadTokens?: number;
		cacheCreationTokens?: number;
		contextWindow?: number;
		costUsd?: number;
		reasoningTokens?: number;
	};
	slashCommands?: string[];
	isPartial?: boolean;
	isReasoning?: boolean;
	toolUseBlocks?: Array<{ name: string; id?; input? }>;
	raw?: unknown;
}
```

### Thinking / Tool Log Contract (REQUIRED for new parsers)

Maestro renders reasoning and tool-execution activity as ephemeral cells whose
lifecycle is governed by the tab's `ThinkingMode` (`'off' | 'on' | 'sticky'`,
defined in `src/shared/types.ts`). **Every parser that surfaces reasoning or
tool activity MUST cooperate with this contract**, otherwise users will see
stale thinking cells leak past the final answer or process exit.

Concretely:

1. **Reasoning chunks**: Emit `ParsedEvent`s with `isReasoning: true`
   alongside `isPartial: true`. The dispatcher routes these to the
   `process:thinking-chunk` IPC channel; the renderer appends them to the
   target tab as `LogEntry { source: 'thinking' }`.
2. **Tool execution**: Emit tool-use events normally. The renderer appends
   them as `LogEntry { source: 'tool' }`.
3. **Final answer text**: Emit non-reasoning text events. The renderer
   appends them as `LogEntry { source: 'stdout' | 'stderr' }`.

The renderer enforces the lifecycle in three coordinated places - parser
authors do **not** need to implement clearing logic, only the correct
`source` tagging:

| Clear point | Where                                               | Trigger                             | Effect (when `showThinking !== 'sticky'`) |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Inline      | `useBatchedSessionUpdates.ts`                       | New `stdout`/`stderr` chunk arrives | Drops prior `thinking`/`tool` entries     |
| On exit     | `useAgentListeners.ts` → `cleanupExitedTabLogs`     | Process `exit` event                | Drops remaining `thinking`/`tool` entries |
| Manual      | `useTabHandlers.ts` → `handleToggleTabShowThinking` | User cycles mode to `'off'`         | Wipes `thinking`/`tool` entries           |

Sticky mode (`'sticky'`) opts out of all three clear points. Off mode
suppresses appending in the first place at the renderer's `onThinkingChunk`
listener.

### Streams vs cards: what may be appended to

A `LogEntry` is one of two things, and coalescing must tell them apart:

- **A stream** - `stdout` / `stderr` / `thinking` text arriving in chunks.
  Consecutive chunks coalesce into one entry so the transcript isn't one
  bubble per packet.
- **A self-contained card** - a `!` command's output, a retry-outage card, a
  session-recovery prompt, a tool call. Its text is owned by whoever created
  it and is updated by log id, never appended to.

Cards keep a **natural `source`**: a command-mode card is `source: 'stdout'`
because its body genuinely is terminal output. So `source` alone cannot tell
you whether appending is safe, and every site that assumed it could has
produced a bug - most recently agent replies being concatenated into a `!`
command's terminal output, because the card was the newest `stdout` entry when
the next chunk arrived (command mode runs _during_ a turn by design, so this
was near-certain rather than a rare race).

The rule lives in one place, `renderer/utils/logEntries.ts`:

- `isSelfContainedCard(entry)` - enumerates the card markers, plus the one
  card that has no marker: Claude's plan-limit banner, which arrives as plain
  `stdout` text and is recognized by `isClaudeLimitNotice()`
- `canAppendToLogEntry(entry, source)` - same source **and** not a card

Used by all three coalescing sites (`useBatchedSessionUpdates` AI-tab path,
its legacy `shellLogs` path, and `useAgentThinkingListener`). Callers keep
their own policy on top (the 500ms window, session-busy). **Adding a new card
kind:** add its marker to `isSelfContainedCard` and every site is correct by
construction.

**Adding a new agent:** make sure your parser tags reasoning deltas with
`isReasoning: true` and emits tool-use events through the standard
`tool_use` ParsedEvent type. Verify the tab transitions to `idle` cleanly
on exit by spot-checking that thinking cells disappear when
`showThinking === 'on'` and persist when `showThinking === 'sticky'` -
covered by `src/__tests__/renderer/hooks/useAgentListeners.test.ts`.

### Tool-Execution Pipeline (end to end)

Tool badges (the "Read", "Bash", "Task" cells with a running/completed/failed
state) flow through a single pipeline shared by every provider. A parser only
has to emit the right `ParsedEvent`; the main process dedups and forwards, and
the renderer merges and draws.

1. **Parse** (`src/main/parsers/agent-output-parser.ts` + each parser). A parser
   emits `ParsedEvent { type: 'tool_use', toolName, toolCallId?, toolState, parentToolUseId? }`.
   `toolState` carries `{ status: 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'error', input?, output? }`.
   `toolCallId` is the stable id that ties a later `completed`/`failed` event
   back to the earlier `running` one. `parentToolUseId` is set when the activity
   was spawned by a parent tool call (claude-code's `Task` subagents; see Phase 2)
   so the renderer can nest it.
2. **Dedup + emit** (`src/main/process-manager/handlers/StdoutHandler.ts`). On a
   `tool_use` event the handler emits a `tool-execution` event on the process
   manager. It keeps a per-process `emittedToolCallIds` Set so a `running` event
   is emitted once per `toolCallId`; the id is removed once the call reaches a
   terminal state, so a reused id is not suppressed. Events without a
   `toolCallId` (some providers) always emit and are attributed downstream by
   tool name.
3. **Forward over IPC** (`src/main/process-listeners/forwarding-listeners.ts`).
   The `tool-execution` event is sent to the renderer on the
   `process:tool-execution` channel and, for web-desktop parity, broadcast to
   connected web clients.
4. **Merge into tab logs** (`src/renderer/hooks/agent/internal/useAgentToolExecutionListener.ts`).
   The listener builds a deterministic log id `tool-${toolCallId}` and merges by
   id, so a `running` cell transitions in place to `completed`/`failed`. Without
   a `toolCallId` it attributes a finalizing event to the most recent still
   `running` entry of the same `toolName`, else appends a fresh entry. Tool
   events are recorded regardless of the `showToolCalls` setting. Visibility is a
   pure render concern: `TerminalOutput` reads `showToolCalls` alone and hides
   `source:'tool'` entries when it is off. **`showToolCalls` and the per-tab
   `showThinking` mode are independent** - the setting was briefly ANDed with
   `showThinking !== 'off'`, which made it impossible to read a reasoning chain
   without the tool noise. The two answer different questions: `showToolCalls`
   decides whether tool cells are DRAWN, `showThinking` decides how long
   `thinking`/`tool` entries are RETAINED. Do not re-couple them. The Settings UI
   groups both under Default Thinking Mode, but the switch is never disabled.
   Storage is governed by the thinking/tool log contract above, so the
   `showThinking` lifecycle can still drop stored `thinking`/`tool` entries (on
   exit, and when new assistant text arrives, unless the tab is `'sticky'`)
   regardless of `showToolCalls`.
5. **Render** (`src/renderer/components/TerminalOutput/components/LogItem.tsx` +
   `src/renderer/components/TerminalOutput/utils/toolSummaries.ts`). `LogItem`
   draws the tool badge and its status; `toolSummaries.ts` turns `toolState.input`
   into the short human summary (e.g. the path a `Read` opened). Child entries
   carrying `parentToolUseId` are grouped under their parent by
   `utils/groupSubagentToolLogs.ts` and collapse behind an expandable
   "N tool call(s)" toggle.

**Per-provider support matrix** (does the parser emit `tool_use` on the live
stream?):

| `factory-droid` | No               | The `-o stream-json` stream Maestro consumes carries only `system`/`message`/`completion`/`error` objects; tool activity is folded into the assistant `message.text` rather than emitted as distinct events. Structured tool events exist only in droid's separate `debug` (SSE) and `jsonrpc` formats, which are a different transport than the JSONL parser reads. To wire this up: capture real `-o stream-json` lines from a `droid` build that forces a tool call and, if a `tool_call`/`tool_result` object appears, extend `factory-droid-output-parser.ts` to emit `tool_use` ParsedEvents |

**AskUserQuestion (Phase 3).** claude-code's `AskUserQuestion` tool is not
answered through this display pipeline but through the permission relay
(`src/main/permission-relay/`): when running interactively in standard
permission mode, the relay recognizes `AskUserQuestion`, surfaces the question
options in the permission prompt UI, and returns the user's selection as the
tool answer. See that directory and the Phase 3 doc for the answer-delivery
contract.

### Parser Implementations

| Parser                     | File                             | Agent Output Format                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `ClaudeOutputParser`       | `claude-output-parser.ts`        | Stream-JSON events (type: system/assistant/result)    |
| `CodexOutputParser`        | `codex-output-parser.ts`         | JSONL (thread.started, agent_message, turn.completed) |
| `OpenCodeOutputParser`     | `opencode-output-parser.ts`      | JSONL (chat.start, text_delta, step_finish)           |
| `FactoryDroidOutputParser` | `factory-droid-output-parser.ts` | Stream-JSON (init, content_block_delta, message_stop) |

### Registry Functions

```typescript
registerOutputParser(parser: AgentOutputParser): void
getOutputParser(agentId: ToolType | string): AgentOutputParser | null
hasOutputParser(agentId: ToolType | string): boolean
getAllOutputParsers(): AgentOutputParser[]
```

### Initialization

Call `initializeOutputParsers()` at app startup (or use `ensureParsersInitialized()` for lazy init):

```typescript
import { initializeOutputParsers } from './parsers';
initializeOutputParsers(); // Registers all 4 parsers
```

## 6. Error Pattern System (`src/shared/agentErrorPatterns.ts`)

Regex-based error detection for agent output. Each agent has patterns organized by error type.

There is ONE bank, and it lives in `shared/` because both processes classify agent output: main parses streaming stdout/stderr through it, and the wizard classifies a finished run through it. `src/main/parsers/error-patterns.ts` is the main-process face of the same module - identical API, plus the logger the shared file cannot import. Import that path from main code and `shared/agentErrorPatterns` from renderer code; both reach the same registry object.

Do NOT start a second bank. The wizard used to carry its own copy of about twenty patterns, which drifted behind this one and told every user to run `claude login` regardless of which of the seven providers had actually failed.

An error `message` here names WHAT failed and stops there. The remedy belongs to whichever surface shows it, because only that surface knows the credential: an agent authenticating with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, a gateway `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and a Bedrock agent all produce `auth_expired` output, and none of them is repaired by a login command. See `classifyCredentialKind()` in `src/shared/providerAuthIdentity.ts`, which is what `ReauthModal` gates its login terminal on.

### Error Types

```typescript
type AgentErrorType =
	| 'auth_expired' // API key invalid, token expired
	| 'token_exhaustion' // Context window full
	| 'rate_limited' // Too many requests
	| 'network_error' // Connection failed
	| 'agent_crashed' // Process exited unexpectedly
	| 'permission_denied' // Lacks required permissions
	| 'session_not_found' // Session deleted or invalid
	| 'unknown'; // Unrecognized error
```

### Error Pattern Structure

```typescript
interface ErrorPattern {
	pattern: RegExp; // Regex to match
	message: string | ((match: RegExpMatchArray) => string); // User message (can use captures)
	recoverable: boolean; // Can recover without user intervention
}

type AgentErrorPatterns = { [K in AgentErrorType]?: ErrorPattern[] };
```

### Dynamic Error Messages

Some patterns use capture groups for rich error messages:

```typescript
{
	pattern: /prompt.*too\s+long:\s*(\d+)\s*tokens?\s*>\s*(\d+)\s*maximum/i,
	message: (match) => {
		const actual = parseInt(match[1], 10).toLocaleString('en-US');
		const max = parseInt(match[2], 10).toLocaleString('en-US');
		return `Prompt is too long: ${actual} tokens exceeds the ${max} token limit.`;
	},
	recoverable: true,
}
```

### Plan-limit notices arrive as a successful `result`, not an error

Claude Code reports a hit plan limit in the `result` field of a `stream-json`
result event ("You've hit your session limit - resets 11:40am (America/Chicago)",
legacy "Claude AI usage limit reached|1755500000"). A result event is the CLI's
own end-of-turn envelope, so it carries no `error` field: without special
handling the notice renders as an ordinary assistant reply, the turn looks
successful, and Agent Resilience never sees a failure to retry.

`isClaudeLimitNotice(text)` is the gate for that branch in
`ClaudeOutputParser.detectError()`. It is anchored at the start of the string and
length-capped on purpose - a result body is normal assistant prose, and agents
working on Maestro discuss rate limits constantly, so running the whole result
through the pattern bank would turn a normal answer into a phantom failure. Keep
the CLI's own wording as the error message rather than the generic pattern text:
it names which limit was hit and when it resets, which is exactly what
`tokenExhaustionResetAt()` in `src/shared/retryClassification.ts` parses to
schedule the retry. That parser accepts a wall-clock reset only when the notice
names its own IANA zone; a bare "resets at 3pm" stays unparseable and falls back
to the hourly poll.

`src/maestro-p/tui-driver.ts` matches the same banner from the TUI's painted
output with `LIMIT_REGEX`, which is line-anchored for the same reason.

### Usage Functions

```typescript
getErrorPatterns(agentId: ToolType | string): AgentErrorPatterns
// Get patterns for agent. Returns {} for unknown agents.

matchErrorPattern(patterns: AgentErrorPatterns, line: string): { type, message, recoverable } | null
// Match line against patterns. Checks types in priority order.

matchSshErrorPattern(line: string): { type, message, recoverable } | null
// Match against SSH-specific patterns. Call for SSH sessions IN ADDITION to agent patterns.

getSshErrorPatterns(): AgentErrorPatterns
// Get the SSH error patterns object.
```

## 7. Session Storage (`src/main/storage/`)

Per-agent session storage for reading historical conversations.

### Expected transcript-read failures (`src/main/utils/session-read-errors.ts`)

Provider transcripts under `~/.claude/projects`, `~/.codex/sessions`, etc. belong
to the agent CLI, not to Maestro. Any code that reads a transcript it merely
_discovered_ on disk must classify environmental failures instead of reporting
them, or one unreadable tree pages a Sentry event per file per refresh
(MAESTRO-W9, MAESTRO-YG/YH/YJ):

```typescript
import { isExpectedSessionReadError } from '../utils/session-read-errors';

try {
	const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
	// ...
} catch (error) {
	if (error instanceof RangeError) {
		logger.warn('Session file too large to parse', LOG_CONTEXT, { filePath });
	} else if (isExpectedSessionReadError(error)) {
		logger.warn('Session file not readable', LOG_CONTEXT, { filePath, error });
	} else {
		captureException(error); // genuine fault, keep reporting
	}
	return null;
}
```

Covers `EACCES`, `EPERM`, `ENOENT`, `ENOTDIR`, `EISDIR`, `EBUSY`. Do NOT widen it
to codes that indicate a Maestro bug (`EMFILE` means we leaked descriptors).
Pair it with the `RangeError` carve-out for oversized files - they are separate
boundaries. When quieting one call site, grep the whole file for other
`captureException` calls on the same failure path (an outer `fs.stat` catch
usually needs the same guard).

### Storage Interface (`src/main/agents/session-storage.ts`)

```typescript
interface AgentSessionStorage {
	readonly agentId: ToolType;

	listSessions(projectPath: string, sshConfig?): Promise<AgentSessionInfo[]>;
	listSessionsPaginated(projectPath, options?, sshConfig?): Promise<PaginatedSessionsResult>;
	readSessionMessages(projectPath, sessionId, options?, sshConfig?): Promise<SessionMessagesResult>;
	getSessionPath(projectPath, sessionId, sshConfig?): string | null;
	deleteMessagePair(projectPath, sessionId, userMessageUuid, fallback?, sshConfig?): Promise<...>;
	searchSessions(projectPath, query, searchMode, sshConfig?): Promise<SessionSearchResult[]>;
}
```

### Base Class (`src/main/storage/base-session-storage.ts`)

`BaseSessionStorage` provides shared logic:

- `listSessionsPaginated()` - Cursor-based pagination over `listSessions()`
- `searchSessions()` - Full-text search with configurable mode (title/user/assistant/all)
- `paginateSessions()` - Static helper for cursor pagination
- `applyMessagePagination()` - Static helper for message pagination (load from end)
- `extractMatchPreview()` - Static helper for search result preview snippets
- `resolveSearchMode()` - Static helper for mode-specific result filtering

Subclasses implement:

- `listSessions()` - Agent-specific session discovery
- `readSessionMessages()` - Agent-specific message loading
- `getSessionPath()` - Agent-specific path resolution
- `deleteMessagePair()` - Agent-specific message deletion
- `getSearchableMessages()` - Load messages for search

### Storage Implementations

| Storage                      | File                               | Session Location                                                     | Format                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `ClaudeSessionStorage`       | `claude-session-storage.ts`        | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/`                                 | Stream-JSON JSONL       |
| `CodexSessionStorage`        | `codex-session-storage.ts`         | `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/`                                      | JSONL events            |
| `OpenCodeSessionStorage`     | `opencode-session-storage.ts`      | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (v1.2+) or `storage/` (legacy) | SQLite (or legacy JSON) |
| `FactoryDroidSessionStorage` | `factory-droid-session-storage.ts` | `~/.factory/sessions/`                                               | JSONL + settings.json   |

### Parse Cache (`src/main/storage/session-info-cache.ts`)

`listSessions()` is enumerate-then-parse for every storage, and the parse is the
expensive half: a heavy Claude user is 5+ GB of JSONL across ~14k transcripts,
which is why the Cost & Tokens dashboard used to take ~15 seconds to render every
single time. `SessionInfoCache` caches the parsed `AgentSessionInfo` keyed by a
`mtimeMs + size` fingerprint, so only new or grown transcripts are re-read.
Enumerating and stat-ing all 14k files costs under 100ms.

Use it instead of hand-rolling another mtime map (there are already several):

```typescript
const files = await this.statProjectSessionFiles(projectDir); // readdir + stat
const sessions = await getSessionInfoCache(this.agentId).resolve(
	projectDir, // scope: one cache file per project folder
	files.map((f) => ({ key: f.filePath, fingerprint: fileFingerprint(f.sizeBytes, f.mtimeMs) })),
	(ref) => parseSessionFile(...), // only called on a miss; null = skip, not cached
	{ prune: true } // ONLY when refs cover the whole scope (never for one page)
);
```

Rules:

- Attach mutable metadata (origin, starred, session name) AFTER `resolve()`. It
  lives in `originsStore` and changes without the transcript changing, so a
  fingerprint would never catch it.
- Returned infos are the cached objects: spread them, never mutate in place.
- Bump `SESSION_INFO_CACHE_VERSION` when `AgentSessionInfo` gains a field, or
  cached entries will come back missing it.
- Tests: `setSessionInfoCacheForTest(agentId, new SessionInfoCache(agentId, tmpDir))`
  in `beforeEach`, or fixtures that reuse one path + stats while varying content
  will (correctly) hit the cache.

Wired up for `ClaudeSessionStorage` (local paths). `CodexSessionStorage` predates
it and still carries its own equivalent cache; the remaining storages parse
everything on every list and should adopt this when their volume justifies it.

### Registry Functions

```typescript
registerSessionStorage(storage: AgentSessionStorage): void
getSessionStorage(agentId: ToolType | string): AgentSessionStorage | null
hasSessionStorage(agentId: ToolType | string): boolean
getAllSessionStorages(): AgentSessionStorage[]
```

### Initialization

```typescript
import { initializeSessionStorages } from './storage';
initializeSessionStorages({
	claudeSessionOriginsStore: store, // Optional: for session names/starred status
});
```

### AgentSessionInfo (Session Metadata)

```typescript
interface AgentSessionInfo {
	sessionId: string;
	projectPath: string;
	timestamp: string; // ISO date of creation
	modifiedAt: string; // ISO date of last modification
	firstMessage: string; // First user message (truncated)
	messageCount: number;
	sizeBytes: number;
	costUsd?: number; // Only for agents with cost tracking
	inputTokens: number;
	outputTokens: number;
	cacheReadTokens: number;
	cacheCreationTokens: number;
	durationSeconds: number;
	origin?: 'user' | 'auto'; // How session was created
	sessionName?: string; // Custom name (if set)
	starred?: boolean; // Starred status
}
```

## Adding a New Agent (Checklist)

1. **Add ID** to `AGENT_IDS` in `src/shared/agentIds.ts`
2. **Add display name** to `AGENT_DISPLAY_NAMES` in `src/shared/agentMetadata.ts`
3. **Add definition** to `AGENT_DEFINITIONS` in `src/main/agents/definitions.ts`
4. **Add capabilities** to `AGENT_CAPABILITIES` in `src/main/agents/capabilities.ts`
5. **Add context window** to `DEFAULT_CONTEXT_WINDOWS` in `src/shared/agentConstants.ts`
6. **Create output parser** in `src/main/parsers/<agent>-output-parser.ts`, register in `src/main/parsers/index.ts`
7. **Add error patterns** in `src/shared/agentErrorPatterns.ts`
8. **Create session storage** in `src/main/storage/<agent>-session-storage.ts`, register in `src/main/storage/index.ts`
9. **Add beta flag** (optional) to `BETA_AGENTS` in `src/shared/agentMetadata.ts`
10. **Add combined context flag** (if applicable) to `COMBINED_CONTEXT_AGENTS` in `src/shared/agentConstants.ts`

TypeScript will enforce completeness for `Record<AgentId, T>` types, guiding you to all required updates.

## Process Management

Agent processes are spawned and managed by `ProcessManager` (`src/main/process-manager/ProcessManager.ts`, re-exported from `src/main/process-manager/index.ts`). The IPC handler in `src/main/ipc/handlers/process.ts` is the entry point.

### Spawn Flow

1. Renderer calls `window.maestro.process.spawn(config)`
2. Handler resolves agent config (custom path, custom args, custom env vars)
3. If SSH enabled, wraps with `wrapSpawnWithSsh()`
4. Builds final command line using agent's argument builders
5. Spawns process via PTY or child_process
6. Attaches output parser for the agent's format
7. Forwards parsed events to renderer via `safeSend()`

### Key IPC Channels (process namespace)

| Channel             | Direction | Purpose                        |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `process:spawn`     | R -> M    | Start agent process            |
| `process:kill`      | R -> M    | Kill process by session ID     |
| `process:write`     | R -> M    | Write to process stdin         |
| `process:interrupt` | R -> M    | Send SIGINT/CTRL+C             |
| `output`            | M -> R    | Parsed agent output events     |
| `process-exit`      | M -> R    | Process exit notification      |
| `usage-update`      | M -> R    | Token/cost statistics          |
| `agent-error`       | M -> R    | Structured error notification  |
| `ssh-remote`        | M -> R    | SSH remote connection info     |
| `tool-execution`    | M -> R    | Tool use events for UI display |

### ProcessConfig (Spawn Request)

Defined in `src/main/process-manager/types.ts`. Note: `toolType` is `string` (not `ToolType`), and resume/model/read-only/yolo/custom-path handling happens upstream in the IPC handler before the config reaches `ProcessManager.spawn()`.

```typescript
interface ProcessConfig {
	sessionId: string;
	toolType: string;
	cwd: string;
	command: string;
	args: string[];
	requiresPty?: boolean;
	prompt?: string;
	shell?: string;
	shellArgs?: string;
	shellEnvVars?: Record<string, string>;
	images?: string[];
	imageArgs?: (imagePath: string) => string[];
	promptArgs?: (prompt: string) => string[];
	contextWindow?: number;
	customEnvVars?: Record<string, string>;
	noPromptSeparator?: boolean;
	sshRemoteId?: string;
	sshRemoteHost?: string;
	querySource?: 'user' | 'auto';
	tabId?: string;
	projectPath?: string;
	runInShell?: boolean;
	sendPromptViaStdin?: boolean;
	sendPromptViaStdinRaw?: boolean;
	sshStdinScript?: string;
	cols?: number;
	rows?: number;
}
```
