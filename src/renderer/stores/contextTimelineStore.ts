/**
 * contextTimelineStore - a per-agent, turn-by-turn record of how the context
 * window fills over the course of a run.
 *
 * Every supported provider normalizes its CLI usage into the shared `UsageStats`
 * shape, and that shape already streams to the renderer per turn over the
 * `process:usage` IPC channel (see useAgentUsageListener). This store taps that
 * SAME stream - it does not add a new listener or any provider-specific code -
 * and keeps a bounded history of points so the inspector panel can draw the
 * turn-by-turn evolution the latest-snapshot UI throws away.
 *
 * Unlike thoughtStreamStore (which gates capture behind an open panel because
 * thinking chunks are high-frequency and memory-heavy), usage events are
 * low-frequency - one per turn - so we capture ALWAYS. That way opening the
 * inspector shows the history that already accumulated, instead of an empty
 * panel that only fills on the next turn.
 *
 * Capture is in-memory only and does not survive an app restart. Each session's
 * buffer is bounded (oldest points dropped past the cap); a `trimmed` flag
 * surfaces that in the UI.
 *
 * Provider notes the panel surfaces (not enforced here - this store only stores
 * numbers): the `contextWindow` denominator is reported live only by some
 * providers (e.g. Codex) and falls back to a static table for others, so a
 * point's `percentage` is precise for some agents and approximate for others.
