/**
 * thoughtStreamStore - live introspection of an agent's thinking/reasoning
 * stream for an Auto Run (goal-based or task/spec-driven).
 *
 * This is a deliberately separate path from `useAgentThinkingListener`, which
 * only records thinking into a tab's logs when that tab's `showThinking` mode
 * is on. Auto Run agents frequently run with thinking display off, so reading
 * from those logs would capture nothing. Here we tap the raw
 * `process:thinking-chunk` IPC stream directly and buffer it in memory,
 * independent of the per-tab display setting.
 *
 * Capture is AMBIENT: every thinking chunk an owned session emits is buffered
 * whether or not the panel is open. That is the whole point of the feature -
 * you go looking at the thought stream BECAUSE a run has been hanging, and if
 * capture only started when you opened the panel you would be handed an empty
 * log at exactly the moment you need the history. Nothing is buffered for an
 * agent that never thinks, so an idle app pays nothing.
 *
 * Lifecycle (driven by the panel UI):
 * - Open:  show the panel for a session, already backfilled with history.
 * - Close: hide the panel. The buffer survives, so reopening still shows the
 *          run's reasoning; `clearBuffer` is the explicit discard.
 *
 * There is deliberately no minimize. Minimize only existed to keep a capture
 * alive while the panel was out of the way; with capture ambient, closing does
 * that already, and a second dismiss control that behaves almost identically to
 * the first is just a choice the user has to think about.
 *
 * The buffer is ONE chronological event list, not a thought list with a tool
 * list beside it. Reasoning and tool calls are captured into the same array in
 * arrival order, which is what lets the feed render a tool call BETWEEN the two
 * halves of the reasoning that produced it. Keeping two sequences and merging
 * them at display time cannot express that: a block is one timestamp, so a tool
 * call that happened mid-block has nowhere to go and surfaces after reasoning
 * that actually followed it. For a feature whose whole value is "watch what the
 * agent is doing, in order", that ordering is the product.
 *
 * Capture is in-memory only - buffers do not survive an app restart. Memory is
 * bounded on three axes so an all-day fleet of agents cannot grow without
 * limit: entries per session, characters per session, and how many sessions
 * retain a buffer at all (least-recently-active evicted first). A `trimmed`
 * flag surfaces per-session dropping in the UI.
