/**
 * Density ladder for the History filter pills (USER / AGENT / AUTO / CUE).
 *
 * The pills share their toolbar row with the search and help buttons, and the
 * row neither wraps nor scrolls. Nothing in it shrinks, so once the pills grew
 * past the space available the overflow spilled out of both ends of a centred
 * row and the two buttons were simply cut off - a control the user cannot see
 * is a control they do not have.
 *
 * A static width threshold cannot decide this. What the row needs depends on
 * the interface font (the root is a proportional face now, whose uppercase
 * glyphs are far wider per em than the monospace the sizes were tuned against),
 * on the Cmd+= zoom, and on whether Cue is on - three or four pills. The panel
 * width knows none of that, which is why the pills fitted at one setting and
 * clipped at another with the same number in `rightPanelWidth`.
 *
 * So the row measures, and this module turns the two measurements into a rung.
 * Pure, and separate from the component, so the arithmetic can be tested
 * without a layout engine.
