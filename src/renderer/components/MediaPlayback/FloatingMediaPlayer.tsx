 * whatever the user is actually working on and follows them across agents and
 * tabs. It can be dragged anywhere on screen, or minimized to the Left Bar.
 *
 * There is only ever one, because only one media file plays at a time - the
 * transport's prev/next step through the queue instead of spawning a second
 * widget, and the history menu jumps to anything played earlier.
 *
 * **Minimize and close mean different things.** Minimizing parks the widget in
 * the Left Bar header and the audio keeps going, because hiding a control
 * should not have the side effect of stopping media; the header pill becomes
 * the play/pause button and brings the widget back. Closing releases the player
 * outright and the sound stops, which is what a close button has to do or the
 * user is left with audio coming from nowhere.
 *
 * The frame is sized to whatever is loaded rather than to a remembered box: an
 * audio file collapses it to the controls, and a video expands it to that
 * video's own aspect ratio. So a queue that alternates between the two reshapes
 * as it advances, and never plays a movie inside black bars or leaves dead
 * space under a podcast. Only the width is the user's to choose, and it is
 * remembered per kind.
