 * How the provider tiles are laid out: a centered block that wraps, or a

 *
 * The shape follows the width the wizard actually has. Everything that fits on
 * one row goes on one row; what needs a second row gets two; only a set too
 * long for two rows falls back to the scrolling strip, because a third row
 * pushes the Continue button below the fold. Widen the wizard and the strip
 * turns back into a block as soon as the tiles fit, so stretching the window
 * buys visible tiles rather than a longer scroll.
 *
 * Height caps the rows the same way width caps the columns. A wizard too short
 * for a second row gets one row, and if the set does not fit across that one
 * row it becomes the strip. Clipping the second row under the fold hides
 * providers with no arrow to say they exist.
 *
 * Rows are BALANCED rather than filled left to right. Five tiles across a
 * four-wide row would draw 4 + 1, which looks like a mistake; splitting them
 * 3 + 2 reads as a deliberate arrangement.
