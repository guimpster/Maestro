/**
 * useAutoRunStateMirror - render another client's Auto Run.
 *
 * Auto Run is renderer-owned state. The run loop is a live async closure, its
 * document/task cursors are `let` bindings inside it, and `batchRunStates` is a
 * plain in-memory zustand store - all of it in whichever client pressed Go (or,
 * for a CLI-launched run, the desktop window main forwarded
 * `remote:configureAutoRun` to). Nothing about a run is written to the session,
 * to settings, or to disk.
 *
 * So a web-desktop browser client, which is a second full renderer over the
 * WebSocket bridge, had no way to learn that a run existed. Every Auto Run
 * surface - the Left Bar batch pill, the thinking pill, the Right Panel active
 * run card, the editor lock - reads `batchRunStates`, and in a browser tab that
 * store stayed empty for the whole run. The agent read as completely idle while
 * the desktop app showed it working.
 *
 * The state was already on the wire: the owning client pushes it to main on
 * every progress tick (`web:broadcastAutoRunState`) and main fans it out to all
 * WebSocket clients as an `autorun_state` packet, replaying the current state
 * for every live run when a client connects. The mobile web app consumes it.
 * The web-desktop shim's frame router simply had no case for it, so it was
 * parsed and dropped. This hook is the consumer for the channel the shim now
 * maps it onto.
 *
 * The mirror runs in BOTH directions, and the second one needed its own
 * plumbing (issue #1519). `autorun_state` only ever reaches WebSocket clients,
 * so a run started in a BROWSER tab had no path back to the Electron app and
 * the desktop drew the agent as idle for the entire run. Main closes that half
 * by forwarding a bridge-originated broadcast straight to the desktop windows
 * on this same channel (`forwardAutoRunStateToDesktopWindows` in
 * `main/ipc/handlers/web.ts`). One consumer, two producers.
 *
 * Note this fixes only VISIBILITY, in both directions. A run still dies with
 * the client that owns it, because the loop and its cursors live there; that is
 * issue #1470 and it needs the ownership primitive described below.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do: take over. The entry it writes is stamped
 * `mirrored: true`, every Auto Run mutator refuses to act on a mirrored entry,
 * and the controls that call them render disabled. Resuming or steering a run
 * from a non-owning client needs a renderer-liveness/ownership primitive that
 * does not exist yet (see issue #1470); without it, two clients driving one
 * agent can spawn duplicate tasks into the same working tree. Displaying is
 * safe, so displaying is all this does.

 * main keeps `isRunning: true` for that agent forever and replays it to every
 * client that connects afterwards. A mirroring client cannot clear that - Stop
 * is disabled by design and every mutator refuses a mirror - so the card would
 * stay up permanently, and `useInputProcessing` would keep queueing the user's

 * Silence alone is not proof: an Auto Run task can be slow, and an error/HITL
