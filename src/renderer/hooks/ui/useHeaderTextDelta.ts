/**
 * Correct the Left Bar header's width thresholds for the current interface font.
 *
 * Those thresholds ("show the wordmark at >= 232px", "show the OFFLINE label at
 * >= 256px") are pixel literals, measured when Maestro was always Roboto Mono at
 * a 14px root. The interface font is a user setting now, so a proportional face
 * at a larger root renders the same strings wider and the header's own labels
 * collide - which is what put the OFFLINE pill underneath the hamburger.
 *
 * Rather than re-deriving each threshold from scratch (which would need every
 * constant split into its icon/padding share and its text share, and would rot
 * again the next time the chrome moves), this measures only what actually
 * changed: how much wider each label is now than it was at the baseline. Each
 * threshold shifts by that delta. A threshold that was right at the baseline
 * stays right, for any font, at any size, at any zoom.
