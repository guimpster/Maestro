 * useElementWidth - track an element's rendered width via ResizeObserver.

 * For layout that has to be computed in JS rather than CSS: an inline SVG chart
 * needs a real pixel width for its viewBox, and a responsive breakpoint that
 * switches column counts needs a number to compare. Anything expressible in CSS
 * should stay in CSS.
 *
 * Returns 0 until the first measurement lands, so callers should treat 0 as
 * "not measured yet" and skip rendering width-dependent content on that frame
 * rather than drawing a zero-width chart.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
 * const width = useElementWidth(ref);
 * return <div ref={ref}>{width > 0 && <Sparkline width={width} ... />}</div>;
 * ```

/**
 * useFreeWidthInFlexRow - how much room a flex child has LEFT, measured from
 * its parent rather than from itself.
 *
 * Reach for this instead of `useElementWidth` when the element's own width is
 * the thing being decided. Measuring yourself in order to choose your own size
 * is circular: you render at some size, measure it, conclude it fits (it is
 * your own width, so it always does), and never move. Squeeze the row and the
 * loop runs the other way, each measurement feeding the next choice, which
 * oscillates.
 *
 * The parent breaks the loop because nothing here depends on the child. The
 * figure returned is the parent's content box minus its other children and the
 * gaps between all of them, so it answers "what is left for me" without ever
 * consulting what the child currently renders as.
 *
 * The child should still be allowed to shrink (`min-w-0` with flex-shrink left
 * at its default) so an answer this hook has not caught up with yet costs a
 * clipped child rather than a row that pushes its neighbours out of view.
 *
 * Siblings are observed alongside the parent, since a row can be squeezed
 * either by the container narrowing or by a neighbour growing.

 * cannot read its own height to decide, because its height IS the row count.
 * The parent's content box minus its other children answers "how tall may I
 * be" without consulting the child.
 *
 * The parent needs a height of its own (a `flex-1 min-h-0` pane inside a sized
