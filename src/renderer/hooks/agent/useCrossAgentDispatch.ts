 * Owns the renderer side of the cross-agent `@mention` pipeline (Phase 03):
 *
 * 1. `sendCrossAgentRequest` windows the source transcript with the Phase-02
 *    heuristics and fires `window.maestro.crossAgent.send(...)`. It's
 *    fire-and-forget: the source chat is never blocked.
 * 2. On mount it subscribes to `window.maestro.crossAgent.onChunk`. As chunks
 *    stream back, it accumulates text per `requestId` and appends/updates a
 *    single `source: 'ai'` LogEntry on the SOURCE tab, stamped with
 *    `metadata.crossAgent` provenance so Phase 04 can render the attribution
 *    pill.
 *
 * Mount the hook once (App-level) so the subscription is a singleton. The send
 * side is a plain module function, not a hook member, because the queue drain
 * dispatches a deferred consult from outside React - see
 * `services/crossAgentMentions` for who calls it and when.
