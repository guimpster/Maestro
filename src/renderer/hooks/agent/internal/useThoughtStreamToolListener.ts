/**
 * useThoughtStreamToolListener - feeds the ACTION half of the Thought Stream.
 *
 * Subscribes to the same raw `process:tool-execution` IPC stream as
 * `useAgentToolExecutionListener`, but routes events into `thoughtStreamStore`
 * rather than into a tab's logs. Two things make that a separate listener
 * rather than a second consumer of the existing one:
 *
 * 1. The in-chat listener resolves the streaming id with `REGEX_AI_TAB` alone,
 *    so an Auto Run - which spawns as `{sessionId}-batch-{timestamp}` - has
 *    every tool call dropped. That is less a bug in that listener than a
 *    consequence of what it does: it writes into `aiTabs[tabId].logs`, and a
 *    batch spawn has no tab to write into. An Auto Run therefore has no
 *    transcript that could carry its tool calls, which is exactly the gap this
 *    fills.
 * 2. The transcript only RENDERS tool entries when the tab's tool-call
 *    visibility is on. The Thought Stream is explicitly the surface for
 *    watching a run you are not otherwise watching, so it must not inherit a
 *    display setting.
 *
 * Scope matches the thinking listener exactly - `AUTO_RUN_SESSION_TYPES`, i.e.
 * Auto Run and nothing else - and imports that set rather than restating it.
 * The two listeners feed ONE timeline, so any divergence in what they admit
 * would interleave a run's actions with some other stream's reasoning. It also
 * keeps the panel from filling with ordinary conversation, which is the
 * over-capture that set is there to prevent.
 *
 * Capture is ambient, matching the thinking listener: a user opens this panel
 * BECAUSE a run has been burning tokens for ten minutes, and a feed that only
 * started recording at open time would hand them an empty list at exactly the
 * moment the history is the answer.
 *
 * There is no rAF/timer coalescing here, unlike the thinking stream. Thinking
 * arrives as a token-rate chunk firehose; tool calls arrive once per agent
 * action, which is orders of magnitude slower and already the granularity the
 * feed displays.
