/**
 * crossAgentAsk - the CLI's face of the cross-agent consult (`maestro-cli ask`).
 *
 * An agent that wants another agent's opinion had exactly one verb before this:
 * `dispatch`, which writes into the target's ACTIVE tab. That drops a question
 * into the middle of whatever conversation the human has open there, and the
 * answer goes to the screen rather than back to the agent that asked. This is
 * the same consult a typed `@mention` performs - a hidden tab on the target,
 * fresh context, no focus, no unread - with the answer returned to the caller
 * instead of streamed into a chat bubble.
 *
 * It is deliberately a thin resolver over {@link sendCrossAgentRequest} rather
 * than a second dispatch path: continuity (the per-caller consult tab and its
 * resumed provider session), history attribution, cancellation, and the SSH /
 * token-mode spawn rules all live there, and a parallel implementation would
 * drift off every one of them.
