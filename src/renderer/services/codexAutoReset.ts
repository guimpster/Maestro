/**
 * codexAutoReset - spend a Codex reset credit automatically when an agent the
 * user opted in hits its plan-quota wall.
 *
 * The manual path is the Usage Dashboard's "Reset now" button. This is the same
 * WRITE primitive fired without a click, for an agent whose
 * `codexAutoResetOnExhaustion` is explicitly on.
 *
 * It is written to refuse far more often than it fires, because the thing it
 * spends is finite, expires, and cannot be refunded. Every gate below is a
 * separate reason to do nothing:
 *
 *  1. **Codex only, opted in only.** No other provider has reset credits, and
 *     the flag defaults off, so an agent that never asked for this can never
 *     reach the spend.
 *  2. **Only a real limit.** A crash, an auth failure, or an availability blip
 *     is not a quota wall, and resetting the window would fix none of them
 *     while costing a credit.
 *  3. **Never on an SSH-backed agent.** The credit would be read and spent
 *     against THIS machine's account while the agent runs as the remote's, so
 *     the spend lands on the wrong account entirely. Same reason the usage
 *     probe skips them.
 *  4. **Freshly confirmed, never assumed.** The credits are re-read immediately
 *     before spending and the verdict must come back `effective` - see
 *     `shouldAutoSpendCredit`, which refuses `wasteful` AND `unknown`. A stale
 *     snapshot is not consent.
 *  5. **Once per outage.** An outage that re-fails after a reset must not walk
 *     the account's whole credit balance one error at a time.
 *
 * On success the agent is left for the existing auto-retry / auto-resume
 * machinery to pick up: the window is open again, so the next scheduled probe
 * succeeds. This deliberately does NOT resend the prompt itself - that is the
 * retry engine's job and duplicating it here would double-send the turn.
