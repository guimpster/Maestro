 * @description Types shared by main + renderer for the cross-agent `@mention`
 * dispatch pipeline (Phase 03).
 *
 * Lives in `src/shared` with NO renderer imports so both the main process
 * (router / IPC handler) and the renderer (dispatch hook) can consume it.
 *
 * Note on `transcript`: the renderer's `LogEntry` is a renderer-only type
 * (`src/renderer/types/index.ts`). Importing it here would drag DOM-only
 * renderer code into the main/cli tsconfigs - exactly the boundary Phase 02's
 * `crossAgentContext.ts` was careful to preserve. So the transcript is typed as
 * {@link CrossAgentTranscriptEntry}, a structural subset of `LogEntry`. A
 * `LogEntry[]` is assignable to `CrossAgentTranscriptEntry[]`, so the renderer
 * can still pass its logs straight through.
