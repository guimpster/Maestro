/**
 * @file cross-agent-router.ts
 * @description Main-process dispatch for cross-agent `@mention` requests
 * (Phase 03).
 *
 * When the user sends `@target ...` from a source agent, the renderer forwards
 * the (Phase-02-windowed) source transcript plus the user's prompt here. We
 * serialize that into a single consultation prompt, spawn an ephemeral batch
 * process for the target agent, buffer its stream-json output, and - once it
 * exits - parse the output to text and stream it back through `onChunk`.
 *
 * Design notes (why it looks like Group Chat):
 * - Spawning + SSH + maestro-p handling is delegated to
 *   {@link spawnGroupChatAgent}, the codebase's one consolidated agent-spawn
 *   helper. We deliberately DO NOT duplicate that SSH/token-mode logic.
 * - Output parsing reuses {@link extractTextFromStreamJson}, the same helper
 *   Group Chat's exit listener uses.
 * - We spawn a FRESH ephemeral PROCESS (process id `cross-agent-<requestId>`)
 *   rather than injecting into the target agent's live/main tab. That keeps the
 *   consultation off the user's own conversation with the target and lets
 *   multiple `@` requests run concurrently.
 * - Continuity WITHOUT pollution: the answer is persisted to a dedicated consult
 *   tab on the target (one per source-tab -> target pairing, owned by the
 *   renderer). When that pairing has been consulted before, the renderer forwards
 *   the target's captured provider session id as `resumeAgentSessionId`, so the
 *   consult resumes (the target remembers prior consults from that source tab)
 *   while the forwarded transcript still supplies the source's latest context.
 *   We capture the target's provider session id off its output stream (the
 *   `session-id` event) and hand it back on the terminal chunk.
 * - Non-blocking by contract: `startCrossAgentRequest` returns once the spawn is
 *   initiated; the response arrives later via `onChunk`.
