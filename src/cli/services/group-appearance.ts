// Shared plumbing for the CLI verbs that write group appearance
// (`create-group`, `update-group`).
//
// The important piece here is `verifyPersistedGroup`. The desktop answers
// `{ success: true }` as soon as the renderer accepted the message, and an
// older desktop that does not know the `icon` / `color` fields accepts the
// message and drops them - reporting success for a change that never happened.
// So after every write we read `maestro-groups.json` back and compare the
// stored values against what was asked for. That catches a version mismatch, a
// silently ignored field, and a clear that did not take, all with one check,
// and it does not rely on the desktop echoing anything back to us.
